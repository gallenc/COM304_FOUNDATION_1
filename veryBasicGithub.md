# Very Basic Github

This is the simplest possible cheat sheet to use github.

## Creating a git account

* Open a browser and go to [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)
* click on `sign up` and create a personal github account (choose a username which you are happy to live with)
* use your personal email and not you university email when signing up.

## Creating an access token

You will need a personal access token to use when you are pushing code to your account.
(A better more secure alternative is to use SSH keys but access tokens will work OK).

* Sign into github usng your new account
* Select your account icon on top right of your github page and select `Settings`

* Under developer settings select Personal Access Tokens / Tokens (Classic) / Generate New Token (Classic)

* under the New personal Access token (classic) add a note (which tells you what this token is for).
* select 90 days for the life of th token. After 90 days you will need to generate a new token.
* select `repo` full control of private repositories. ( do not select other permissions)
* select `Generate token`

* The token will be generated and will only be visible once. Copy the token to a safe place. Treat it like a password.
