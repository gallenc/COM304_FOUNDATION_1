# **Session 1**

## A short history of Computing, Github, Project Plans and starting with a raspberry Pi

I was unforunately a late starter so I was not in attendance for this lesson, However I caught up at a later date

We covered a quick glimpse into the history of computing, starting from the Abacus "a simple device for calculating, consisting of a frame with rows of wires or grooves along which beads are slid." all the way up to "cloud" computing

Quick video I found that gives a quick but detailed version of this "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-M6lANfzFsM&ab_channel=Futurology%E2%80%94AnOptimisticFuture"


## Starting with git

Setting up a account on "github.com"
Github is a website/tool invented by Linus Torvalds designed to work collaboratively on projects
Some examples of Github projects "https://github.com/collections/github-pages-examples"

## markdown
Basic Tutorial on markdown https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJojC3lSkwg&ab_channel=SteveGriffith-Prof3ssorSt3v3
A generally useful channel for github tutorials https://www.youtube.com/@SteveGriffith-Prof3ssorSt3v3/videos



# **session 2**

## Computer architecture, Github clone n merge, binary and boolean

Basic principles

### turing machine

"a mathematical model of a computer that reads and writes symbols on an infinite tape to perform computations"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNRDvLACg5Q&ab_channel=Computerphile quick 5 min video explains how, what, why
In short how much maths can we do using algerithms 

### "von Neumann architecture" - based on john neumann design in 1945

https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/von-neumann-architecture#:~:text=The%20Von%20Neumann%20architecture%20consists,and%20a%20program%20control%20unit. Very long and detailed bit of info on it

"The Von Neumann architecture consists of a single, shared memory for programs and data, a single bus for memory access, an arithmetic unit, and a program control unit"


### Types of memory

https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/cpu/ - Bit of history about CPU's and components

off cpu standard storage e.g SRAM, Disk (ssd/hdd) etc etc

on cpu - 

Registers - high speed memory storage locations within the cpu that holds data that is currently being worked on by the CPU 

Arithmetic Logic unit - Performs basic arithmetic operations and logic operations (and, or, not) on data from the register

Memory managment unit - these handle memory related tasks e.g managing CPU and RAM interaction, along with cache memory

Cache - Stores data frequently used by cpu for faster access


### x86 and ARM architecure

https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/understanding-arm-vs-x86-architecture-key-differences-suresh-guttula-e0zyc#:~:text=ARM%20and%20x86%20architectures%20serve,%2C%20servers%2C%20and%20gaming%20systems. 

x86 = Performance        ARM = Power Efficency   (to make it very simple!)


# **Session 3**   

### Logic gates

https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/logic-gate-AND-OR-XOR-NOT-NAND-NOR-and-XNOR#:~:text=A%20logic%20gate%20is%20a,of%20logic%20gates%20in%20them. Shows the various types of logic gates along how they work

"A logic gate is a device that performs a logical operation on binary inputs and produces a single binary output"
In other words, takes binary input and gives binary output depending on the requirment of the gate

### Raspbery Pi and Gertboard

Looked at GPIO (general-purpose input/output) on the pi - A physical output on the board to control something external e.g turn on a 5v header to control a LED

Node Red - No code programming, "programmed" basic traffic light setup along with a simple on/off LED using switches and Delays (self explanatory)

lesson mainly wiring up board and getting set up, due to issues with getting Node red working etc (Always bring a Memory stick makes life alot easier!)
